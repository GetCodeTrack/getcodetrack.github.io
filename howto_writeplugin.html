            CodeTrack has its own plugin system which allows you to extend it the way you want. Your plugins can also be shared with
            others.
            <br/> Plugins are usually based on one or more Deeptrace method rulesets, so please make sure you read about rulesets
            first:
            <a href="rulesets.html">DeepTrace method rulesets</a>
            <br/>

            <ul>
                There are 2 main categories of plugins:
                <li>
                    <b>Viewplugins :</b> giving you the possibility to visualize your traced data any way you want.</li>
                <li>
                    <b>Valueplugins :</b> these allow you to represent argument and return values in a custom way.</li>


                Note that you can combine one or more of any of these 2 type of plugins in the same assembly. In this documentation however,
                there's just one type per assembly to keep things simple and clear.
            </ul>

            <ol>
                <li>Go to the sample github page (
                    <a href="https://github.com/GetCodeTrack/PluginSamples/tree/master/MyPlugin" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://github.com/GetCodeTrack/PluginSamples/tree/master/MyPlugin',false); return false;">My Plugin github</a>).</li>
                <li>Download the sample</li>
                <li>In the project properties, rename "MyPlugin.Plugins" to whatever you like (
                    <b>just make sure the assembly ends with .plugins.dll for codetrack to find and load your plugin</b>
                </li>
                <li>Choose a namespace of your liking</li>
                <li>Replace all 'MyPlugin' strings with the name you choose earlier</li>
                <li>Replace all 'MyNamespace' strings with the namespace you choose earlier</li>
                <li>In MyPlugin.cs, make sure to
                    <b>replace the guid</b> with a new one. This is necessary to uniquely identify your plugin (especially if
                    you want to share it later)</li>
                <li>Now build the project (make sure to restore the nuget packages)</li>
                <li>Now you should have a xyz.plugins.dll that you can place next to codetrack.exe or under the right version
                    in %localappdata%/codetrack/ (both work equally fine)
                    <br/>
                    <b>Note that your file should end with
                        <i>.plugins.dll</i> for codetrack to consider it a plugin assembly!</b>
                </li>
                <li>Start Codetrack and go to the settings page and select 'plugins', now you should see your plugin.</li>
                <li>If you open a trace and go to the timeline view, your plugin should be listed with the 2 default plugins.
                    If all goes well you should see a clickable button</li>
            </ol>

        </p>

        <p>Congratulations, you now have a hello world plugin!
            <br/>Of course that's not so useful just yet. To get some inspiration, the two plugins that are provided with CodeTrack
            by default, are also available in Github :

                <li>Go to the sample github page (

                    you want to share it later)</li>
                <li>Now build the project (make sure to restore the nuget packages)</li>
                <li>Now you should have a xyz.plugins.dll that you can place next to codetrack.exe or under the right version

                        <i>.plugins.dll</i> for codetrack to consider it a plugin assembly!</b>
                </li>

                <li>The assembly you just built should already be useable: it contains just a simple valueplugin that replaces
                    values of type System.Uri by their string representation.
                    <br/>You probably want to implement something more exciting than this, so after testing the default behavior
                    you can just continue with the next steps to replace this with your own.
                </li>

                <li>If your plugin requires one or more specific rulesets, you can embed them in your plugin assembly (see:
                    <a href="#">Embedding rulesets</a>)
                    <br/>If you don't want any rulesets, make sure to delete the sample .json file under the rulesets folder</li>
                <li>Now you are ready to start implementing the real functionality of your valueplugin: You can do this by replacing
                    the content of the CanConvert() and Convert() methods of your plugin.</li>

                <li>Start Codetrack and go to the settings page and select 'plugins', now you should see your plugin.</li>
                <li>If you open a trace which had methods traced that matched your ruleset, the arguments matching your value
                    plugin should now be presented the way you specified.
                    <br/>You can check this in the properties of a call or in the generic plugin.</li>
            </ol>

        <a name="EmbeddingRulesets"></a>
        <h4>Embedding rulesets</h4>
        <p>
            By embedding one or more rulesets, you can make sure that users can easily take a trace with the info that your plugin needs.
            All embedded rulesets in plugin assemblies will autmatically be included in the ruleset library. To add a ruleset
            just follow these simple steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Create the ruleset you want by starting CodeTrack and configuring a new rulest in the deeptrace library (you
                    can find this under the setitngs tab). For More info on doing this check
                    <a href="rulesets.html#Create">Creating RuleSets</a>
                </li>
                <li>Once you are happy with the ruleset (tip: test it first, by taking a trace and see if the trace contains
                    the info you expect), you can click on the copy link in the upper right corner of the library.
                </li>
                <li>Now go to your plugin project and add a json file. You can name it whatever you want, as long as it ends
                    with '.ruleset.json'.</li>
                <li>In that file you can now paste the content of your clipboard (this should be the json containing your ruleset).</li>
                <li>Make sure you set all 'IsReadOnly' fields to true (this way users won't be able to change your ruleset).</li>
                <li>Also fill in your information (author and authorcontact) if you really plan on sharing your plugin.</li>
                <li>Last step is to set the build action of the json file to 'Embedded resource'</li>
                <li>That's it! Your ruleset(s) should now be added to the library if you restart codetrack after you placed your
                    assembly next to the codetrack executable.</li>
            </ol>
